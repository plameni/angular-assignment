# AngularAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Branches

The github repo consist of three branches: main, bootstrap-observable and rxjs-shared-state. 

On the main branch, there is a version of the code that uses flexbox for styling, and does not include rxjs in any way. 

bootstrap-observable branch contains positioning and styling with Bootstrap, and uses Observable Data Service implementation in Angular. 

rxjs-shared-state contains one way of creating angular service using BehaviorSubject. 

I didn't go much into styling the solution considering there were no specific UI requirements, and they are usually provided by the designer.
